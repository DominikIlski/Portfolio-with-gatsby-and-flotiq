_I haven't really spent any time adding the JS animations or removing any unused CSS (automatically done by PurgeCSS). You will also need HTML in your Markdown file in order to add CSS classes to your images_

_First time with Gatsby? Take a look on the [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use `npx` and the Gatsby CLI to create a new project

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    npx gatsby new my-awesome-portfolio https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-projects
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-awesome-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
