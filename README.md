_I haven't really spent any time adding the JS animations or removing any unused CSS (automatically done by PurgeCSS). You will also need HTML in your Markdown file in order to add CSS classes to your images_

_First time with Gatsby? Take a look on the [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## ðŸš€ Quick start

If you never used Gatsby before, I highly recommend you to [set up your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)!

To copy and install this starter run this command:

```bash
$ gatsby new project-portfolio https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-projects
```

The main data source of this starter is a Projects Content Type in [Flotiq.com](https://flotiq.com), after you [register](https://editor.flotiq.com/register.html), you can choose `Project` when you create your first Content Type Definition (all you need to do is follow the tutorial on Flotiq Dashboard).

Next - add some projects in Flotiq! Hint: you can use the integrated Unsplash media library to pull some awesome pictures.

The last step is to configure the application to know from where it has to fetch the data, this is going to be made by using `environment variables`. You need to create a file called `.env` inside the root directory of the project, with the following structure:

```js
GATSBY_FLOTIQ_BASE_URL=https://api.flotiq.com
FLOTIQ_API_KEY=YOUR API KEY
```

To get YOUR API KEY check out [documentation](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/).

After this you can start development:
```
gatsby develop
```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
